### Projects
##### See more on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/camji55)

##### [CarCare](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/car-care/id1434870957?ls=1&mt=8) - iOS App
CarCare is an iOS application the notifies the user when
it's time to give their car an oil change. Notifications are
determined by a calculation that takes in the average
amount of miles a user drives a year, and the miles they
want between oil changes.

##### [Wi-Fi Connect](https://wificonnect.xyz) - iOS App (Work in Progress)
Wi-Fi Connect removes the need to ask friends for Wi-Fi
passwords. Instead, it uses a friends system. Become
freinds in the app and then you can connect! Wi-Fi
connect makes connecting to the internet faster, more
secure, and more efficient when compared to todayâ€™s
methods.
